# Starbucks Capstone Project
## Introduction
This repository contains the analysis for the Starbucks Capstone Challenge, part of the Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity. The project explores customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app to determine which demographic groups respond best to which type of offer (discount, BOGO, or informational).

## Libraries Used
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
json
datetime
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
imblearn

## Project Motivation
This project aims to leverage the data provided by Starbucks, simulating customer transactions and interactions with offers sent through the mobile app. The goal is to understand the effectiveness of different promotional offers across various customer demographics, thereby enabling Starbucks to tailor their marketing strategies more efficiently.

## Files in the Repository
 - **Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and insights.
 - **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and repository.
 - **pic1.png,pic2.png**: These images are used in Jupyter notebook for explaining the notebook terminal update process.

## Analysis Summary
The analysis involved several key steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Understanding the distribution of customer demographics and offer types.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data and preparing it for modeling, including encoding categorical variables and handling missing values.
3. **Model Building**: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict customer response to offers.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy and F1 score metrics.

## Key Findings:
 - Certain demographic groups showed a higher propensity to respond to BOGO and discount offers than to informational offers.
 - Model performance indicated that demographic features significantly influence the effectiveness of offers.
 - Suggestions for targeted marketing strategies were developed based on the insights gained from the analysis.
